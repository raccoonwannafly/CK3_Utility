# Morph Lab Guide

The Morph Lab (Comparator) is a tool for "Gene Alchemy".

## How to use
1.  **Paste DNA**: Paste a character's DNA string into the workbench.
2.  **Load Mod Files**: Upload `.txt` files from a mod (e.g., EPE) that contain `morph = { ... }` definitions.
3.  **Comparison**: The grid shows the raw values.
    *   **Green**: Value is higher than the reference.
    *   **Red**: Value is lower than the reference.

## Sweet Spot Mixing
The "Mix Columns" feature uses a weighted random formula to create natural variations:
```
Average (E) = (A + B) / 2
Difference (D) = abs(A - B)
Range = [E - D/4,  E + D/4]
Result = Random(Range)
```
This ensures the child looks related to the parents but isn't just a strict linear average.
