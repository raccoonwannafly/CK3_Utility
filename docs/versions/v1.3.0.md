# Ver 1.3.0

## Core
*   **Storage Engine Upgrade**: Migrated from **localStorage** to **IndexedDB**.
    *   *Why?* To support storing high-resolution images and unlimited character data without hitting the 5MB browser quota.
    *   *Migration:* The app automatically detects legacy local storage data and moves it to the new database on first load.

## Gallery Hub
*   **Collections**: Characters can now be organized into custom Folders/Collections.
*   **Bulk Actions**: Added ability to Move or Delete multiple characters at once.
*   **UX Improvements**: 
    *   Replaced native prompts with custom Modals for a unified UI.
    *   Added Sidebar navigation for filtering by collection.
    
## Developer Hub
*   **Restructure**: Split "Dev Log" into "Version History" (Changelog) and "Dev Notes" (Ideas/Technical Specs).
*   **Virtual File System**: All documentation is now loaded from external text definitions to simulate a CMS structure.
