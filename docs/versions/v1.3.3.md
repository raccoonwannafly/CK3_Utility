# Ver 1.3.3 - Gallery Polish & Sorting

2026-01-01

Major UX & Visual Enhancement Update

### Gallery Hub

- **Advanced Sorting**: Added support for sorting characters by **Dynasty**, **House**, **Recently Edited**, and **Recently Added**.
- **Visual Grandeur**: High Fame ("The Living Legend") and Devotion ("Paragon of Virtue") levels now feature an **animated pulsing glow** effect.
- **Card Size Controls**: Added a toolbar toggle to switch between Small (S), Medium (M), and Large (L) grid layouts.
- **Improved Contrast**: Enhanced character card readability with stronger background gradients and high-contrast text shadows.

### Theme & Visibility

- **Light Mode Fixes**: 
  - Fixed "unreadable text" issues on character cards by forcing dark overlays to retain white text.
  - Improved visibility for settings toggles and dropdown menus.
  - Standardized sidebar branding visibility for a cleaner light experience.

### Technical Improvements

- **Lifecycle Tracking**: Characters now track `updatedAt` timestamps in both the backend and local storage to enable the "Recently Edited" sorting feature.
- **CSS Specificity**: Implemented extreme specificity rules to ensure theme overrides correctly handle Tailwind utility classes.
