# Ver 1.3.1 - Gallery UX & Import Fixes

## Gallery Hub
*   **Visual Overhaul**: 
    *   Character names are now significantly larger and more prominent in the Details view.
    *   Culture, Religion, and Prestige/Piety stats have been restyled for better readability with higher contrast backgrounds.
*   **Image Navigation**: 
    *   Added **Previous/Next** navigation arrows in the Full Screen image view.
    *   Added a **Quick Zoom** button to the thumbnail strip, allowing you to view secondary images in full screen without setting them as the main portrait.
*   **Data Entry**:
    *   Added **Dynasty Motto** field to the character creator.
    *   Added **Tags** support (press Enter to add) for better categorization.

## Bug Fixes
*   **JSON Import**: Fixed an issue where importing legacy JSON files or files from certain environments failed silently. The parser is now more robust.
*   **File Input**: Improved the file selection reset mechanism to allow re-importing the same file immediately if needed.
