Morph Lab Updates
Morph Lab
Updated Slider Range

Changed the Smart Cell Editor slider range to 0.0-1.0 to better reflect how values are handled in modding files, while still supporting DNA byte value conversion internally.
Remove Morph Template

Added the ability to select "No Template" (or remove an existing template assignment) directly from the Smart Cell Editor dropdown. This is crucial for advanced modding scenarios where a specific template override is not desired.
Smart Cell Editor Positioning

Fixed an issue where the cell editor popup would overflow off the screen if the column was near the right edge or bottom. The editor now intelligently calculates available space and flips/shifts its position to remain visible.
