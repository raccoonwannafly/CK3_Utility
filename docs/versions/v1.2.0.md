# Ver 1.2.0 Gallery & Navigation Overhaul
2025-12-31

Transformed the Gallery from a flat list into a full organizational system.

    Collections: Added support for creating custom Albums/Collections to group characters (e.g., "Campaign 1", "Mod Testing").
    Sidebar Layout: Implemented a sidebar for quick filtering between "All", "Historical", "Unsorted", and custom collections.
    Bulk Actions: Added a "Move to..." feature to bulk-assign characters to collections.
    UX Fix: Replaced the native prompt() for creating collections with a custom Modal to ensure consistent UI and styling.

Navigation Structure

    Prioritization: Moved core technical tools (DNA Converter, Gallery, DNA Forge) to the top of the main sidebar.
    Grouping: Moved roleplay-focused tools (Trait Planner, Character Sheet) to a "Work in Progress" section to better reflect the current development focus.
